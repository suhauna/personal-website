# Suhauna Hussain



Hi, my name is Suhauna. I'm a metro intern at the [Tampa Bay Times.](https://www.tampabay.com/writers/?plid=suhauna-hussain) 

This past summer, I worked at the [Center for Public Integrity,](https://www.publicintegrity.org/authors/suhauna-hussain) a nonprofit investigative newsroom, as an intern on federal politics team covering money-in-politics. 

I recently graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in political economy. While in Berkeley, I held several reporting and editing roles at Berkeley's independent student-run newspaper, [The Daily Californian.](http://www.dailycal.org/author/shussain) There, I covered the campus’s multimillion dollar deficit, high profile sexual harassment cases, contentious “free speech” events, black lives matter protests and tuition hikes. 

I have also reported for the [East Bay Express,](https://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/ArticleArchives?author=5098046) an alternative weekly newspaper and provided analytical coverage of college campuses across the U.S. at The [Chronicle of Higher Education.](https://www.chronicle.com/article/When-Colleges-Use-Their-Own/241466)
